Controlling a Robot Arm: Joint State Publisher, Moveit, and Kinematics
In this repository, I will detail the process of controlling a robot arm using ROS (Robot Operating System), specifically focusing on three key components: Joint State Publisher, Moveit, and kinematics. These tools are essential for simulating, planning, and executing movements for robotic arms in a virtual environment.
Forking the Repository
I began by forking the original arduino_robot_arm repository from [smart-methods] to my own GitHub account. This repository provides a foundation for controlling a robotic arm, integrating hardware control and simulation capabilities using ROS
Setup Environment
Operating System and ROS Version

. Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04
. ROS Version: ROS Noetic
Requirements
Preparing ROS Create a workspace by using catkin_make
http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace
Add the “arduino_robot_arm” package to “src”
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
sudo apt install git
git clone githttps://github.com/smart-methods/arduino_robot_arm
Install all the dependencies
cd ~/catkin_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-moveit
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-joint-state-publisher ros-noetic-joint-state-publisher-gui
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-gazebo-ros-control joint-state-publisher
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-ros-controllers ros-noetic-ros-control
Compile the package
catkin_make
Controlling the robot arm by joint_state_publisher
joint_state_publisher provides a straightforward way to manually control and visualize the movements of each joint of a robot arm, facilitating tasks such as calibration, basic movement testing, and initial setup in robotic applications developed with ROS.
This command initiates nodes that monitor and manage the operational status of motors within the robotic arm using ROS.

roslaunch robot_arm_pkg check_motors.launch
This command launches nodes to simulate and monitor the behavior of motors within the robotic arm using Gazebo in ROS.

roslaunch robot_arm_pkg check_motors_gazebo.launch
This command runs a Python script that publishes joint states to Gazebo, enabling visualization and simulation of a robotic arm's movements within the ROS ecosystem.

rosrun robot_arm_pkg joint_states_to_gazebo.py
Controlling the robot arm by Moveit and kinematics
moveit_pkg serves as a comprehensive toolkit within ROS for developing, testing, and deploying sophisticated motion planning and control applications for robotic systems.

MoveIt Controlling:

This command sets up a demo environment in ROS with MoveIt, enabling visualization, motion planning, and execution capabilities for a robotic system.

roslaunch moveit_pkg demo.launch
